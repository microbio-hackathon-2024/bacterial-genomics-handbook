Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can assemble Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser.It can also assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a miniasm+Racon pipeline. 
For the best possible assemblies, give it both Illumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a short-read-first hybrid assembly.
