title: "Donâ€™t Panic! Your Bacterial Genomics Handbook"
---

## Overview

This handbook offers a digestible set of information for anyone just getting started with a microbial genomics project. Whether you're a bioinformatician, a member of a laboratory team, an epidemiologist, or a practitioner interested in using genomics but unfamiliar with the process, this resource is designed to give you a basic grounding in the main concepts and approaches you need to know. 

The aspects we cover in this document regarding Microbial genomics relates to the application of whole genome sequencing to addressing research questions relating to microbiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary biology. Bioinformatics analysis can use many data types but in this document we focus on whole genome shotgun sequencing of extracted DNA from cultured isolates or from complex samples (e.g. microbial communities as metagenomics). We will not cover specifics of targeted/amplicon sequencing or other data beyond genome sequencing such as image analysis from microscopy or molecular dynamics.  At this time, guidance is tailored to bacterial genomics, rather than viral or fungal genomics.
