It is important to remember that *threshold* is a {% glossary heuristic %} for measuring evolutionary history - we try to test and find distributions to make conclusions about finding cutpoints to categorize genomes into groups. A big assumption around thresholds comes from the Neutral Theory of Evolution (cite), which assumes that evolution is driven by neutral mutations occurring at a regular rate. This predictability of divergence then becomes a way for us to make assumptions about calendar time and evolutionary history between two individuals.  

## Reasoning

Typical reasons we might set and test a threshold is to identify transmission clusters, species cutoffs, or associations with outcomes/exposures of interest. Thresholds are data dependent, and they can potentially change in an analysis based on new information, for example in the context of an outbreak investigation. 

## Setting a threshold

Thresholds based on genomic information are set using information about the biology of bacteria and the time frame in which they are found. They can take the form of any genomic distance. Common measures include allelic differences, ANI, and SNP distance. Before you set a threshold to make your groupings, it is important that you know this information about your bacterium of interest: 

- Mutation rate of the species
- How likely is it that your species of interest recombines?
- What is known about horizontal gene transfer in the species?
- What is the epidemiological timeline of interest?
- What is known about the life history and or niches of your bacterium?
