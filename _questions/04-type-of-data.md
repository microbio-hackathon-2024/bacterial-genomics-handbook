In most scenarios, your input data may come in the form of either a FASTQ file or a FASTA file. A FASTQ file is a text file that contains sequence read data and its corresponding quality score. These files are generated by sequencing machines and have a strict format. FASTQ files contain four line-separated fields for each sequence. The first field begins with “@” and contains the sequence or read identifier. The next field contains the actual sequence information. The third field contains the separator “+”, and the last field contains the quality scores for each character or base in the second field.

```

A FASTA file is a text file that contains nucleotide or protein sequences. They are formatted differently than FASTQ files and are generated via assemblers. Each sequence in a FASTA file contains two fields. The first field always begins with a “>” followed by a sequence identifier. The next lines immediately following the sequence identifier contains the sequence information. FASTA files can be generated by assembling FASTQ files using a genomic assembler such as Unicycler, SPAdes, or Flye. An example FASTA file is listed below:

```
