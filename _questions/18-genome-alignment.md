Genome alignment is the process of lining up similar regions shared between two or more sequences (homologous regions). This is useful when you are trying to compare multiple sequences to one another to look for similarities or differences. When DNA or RNA sequences are lined up, we can make inferences about changes that could have occurred because of functional or evolutionary histories. Gaps may be introduced into alignments so that regions of homology can line up accurately. One output of an alignment is a consensus sequence, which is a summary sequence of the most common genomic areas of all genomes used in the alignment. There are different approaches to how many sequences or which parts of the genome you want to compare. See [How much of the genome should I compare]((https://microbio-hackathon-2024.github.io/bacterial-genomics-handbook/questions/15-genome-comparison.html). for more information!
